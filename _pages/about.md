The first years of life significantly influence later behavioral, emotional, and social development. A critical and adjustable risk factor for later mental health issues is the early regulation of bodily functions, such as sleep-wake cycles, self-soothing, and eating. Around 20% of infants experience regulatory problems (RPs) with crying, sleeping, and/or feeding, with 2-8% facing multiple or prolonged RPs. These RPs can negatively impact long-term behavioral, emotional, and social outcomes.

A project running from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2027, aims to investigate the impact of early RPs on mental health from childhood to adulthood. The study will examine neurobiological markers that might explain these effects using data from three population-based studies in different countries (Generation R, ALSPAC, and BLS). The project will develop novel analytical tools for brain surface analysis and will explore neurobiological pathways through brain structure and function. Additionally, it will use the HiTOP framework to improve the characterization of adverse outcomes of early RPs, potentially leading to new insights into the neurobiology and effects of RPs on mental health.
